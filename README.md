## 🧠 How It Works

This app uses:

- **PyTorch & ResNet18** for image classification  
- **Optuna** for automated hyperparameter tuning  
- **Hugging Face Hub** for secure model storage  
- **Streamlit** for interactive UI deployment

Models are stored privately on Hugging Face and loaded at runtime using secure tokens.
